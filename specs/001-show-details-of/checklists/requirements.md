# Specification Quality Checklist: Book Details View

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-07
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Validation Notes**:

- ✅ Specification avoids Vue.js, component, or implementation specifics
- ✅ User scenarios focus on what users need and why
- ✅ Language is accessible to business stakeholders
- ✅ All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Validation Notes**:

- ✅ Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers in specification
- ✅ All functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-020) are testable with clear acceptance criteria
- ✅ Success criteria use concrete metrics (time, percentages, scores)
- ✅ Success criteria avoid technical jargon (e.g., "users can navigate" vs "Vue Router navigates")
- ✅ User stories include complete acceptance scenarios with Given-When-Then format
- ✅ Edge cases section covers 8 different scenarios including error states and missing data
- ✅ Scope section clearly defines in-scope vs out-of-scope items
- ✅ Assumptions section documents 8 assumptions about existing functionality
- ✅ Dependencies section lists required systems

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Validation Notes**:

- ✅ Each FR can be validated through testing (e.g., FR-001: verify navigation works by clicking book)
- ✅ Three prioritized user stories cover: viewing details (P1), managing status (P2), sharing (P3)
- ✅ Ten success criteria provide measurable outcomes for feature success
- ✅ Specification remains implementation-agnostic throughout

## Validation Summary

**Status**: ✅ **PASSED** - All quality checks passed

**Strengths**:

1. Comprehensive user scenarios with clear prioritization (P1, P2, P3)
2. Detailed functional requirements covering navigation, display, status management, and UX
3. Measurable success criteria with specific metrics
4. Thorough edge case analysis
5. Well-defined scope with clear in/out boundaries
6. No clarifications needed - all decisions use reasonable defaults

**Ready for Next Phase**:

- ✅ Ready for `/speckit.clarify` (if needed for additional details)
- ✅ Ready for `/speckit.plan` (technical planning can begin)

## Notes

No issues identified. Specification is complete and ready for technical planning phase.

The specification successfully balances detail with technology-agnosticism, providing clear guidance for implementation while remaining accessible to non-technical stakeholders.
