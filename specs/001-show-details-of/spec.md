# Feature Specification: Book Details View

**Feature Branch**: `001-show-details-of`
**Created**: 2025-10-07
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "show details of a book in its own view"

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Browse and View Book Information (Priority: P1)

A user browsing the book collection wants to see comprehensive information about a specific book by clicking on it from the list view, which opens a dedicated detail page showing all available information including cover image, title, author, publication year, and description.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition of the feature - allowing users to access detailed information about books. Without this, users cannot make informed decisions about which books to read or add to their reading list.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by clicking any book card from the book list and verifying the detail page loads with all book information displayed. Delivers immediate value by providing users with comprehensive book information in a focused, distraction-free view.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is on the book list page, **When** they click on a book card, **Then** they are navigated to a detail page showing that book's full information
2. **Given** a user is viewing book details, **When** the page loads, **Then** they see the book's cover image, title, author, year (if available), and description (if available)
3. **Given** a user is viewing book details, **When** they want to return to the list, **Then** they can click a back button or use browser navigation to return to the previous view

### User Story 2 - Manage Reading Status from Details (Priority: P2)

A user viewing book details wants to manage the book's reading status (to-read, currently-reading, read) directly from the detail page without returning to the list or kanban view.

**Why this priority**: Enhances user workflow by allowing status management in context. Users often decide to change a book's status after reading its full description, making this action natural at the detail level.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by opening a book detail page and changing its reading status through a status selector, then verifying the status persists when returning to other views (list or kanban). Delivers value through improved workflow efficiency.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is viewing book details, **When** they select a reading status from a dropdown or button group, **Then** the book's status is updated and reflected across all views
2. **Given** a book has an existing reading status, **When** the detail page loads, **Then** the current status is clearly displayed and highlighted
3. **Given** a user changes a book's status, **When** they return to the list or kanban view, **Then** the book appears in the correct location with the updated status

---

### User Story 3 - Share or Reference Book (Priority: P3)

A user viewing book details wants to share the book with others or bookmark it for later by copying a direct URL to the specific book's detail page.

**Why this priority**: Enables collaboration and content sharing. While not critical for MVP, shareable URLs improve user experience and make the application more useful for reading groups or recommendations.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by copying a book detail page URL, pasting it in a new browser tab or sharing with another user, and verifying it loads the correct book's details. Delivers value through enhanced sharing capabilities.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is viewing a book's details, **When** they copy the page URL, **Then** the URL contains a unique identifier for that specific book
2. **Given** a user has a book detail URL, **When** they paste it in a browser and load the page, **Then** they see that specific book's detail page
3. **Given** a book ID doesn't exist, **When** a user navigates to that detail URL, **Then** they see a helpful error message and a link to return to the book list

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a book has no cover image available?
- What happens when a book has no description or it's empty?
- What happens when optional fields (year, description) are missing?
- How does the page handle a book ID that doesn't exist in the system?
- What happens if the user navigates directly to a detail page without coming from the list (e.g., bookmarked URL)?
- How does the back navigation work if the user accessed the detail page via direct URL rather than from the list?
- What happens on mobile devices with limited screen space for displaying all information?
- How is the loading state handled while book data is being fetched?
